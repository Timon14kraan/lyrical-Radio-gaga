
Song: Radio - gaga

deel van Tim
I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio

deel van Matthijs
You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly (radio)
